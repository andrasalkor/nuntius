# Nuntius
The purpose of this project is to build a simple Roguelike that takes place in my fictional Latin setting. In-game, you play as a nuntius, a messenger, who is given a very difficult job: to reach the underground cities.

## Features
All currently existing features are very early WIPs. Frankly, beyond a simple generated map (that is half-broken) and a movable player character, there is not much to do here.

### Randomly Generated Maps
The dungeons in Nuntius are all randomly generated and will be populated by monsters, items, and structures.

Currently, there is only one type of map, called the SimpleMap, which generates a few interconnected (well... usually interconnected) rooms and places the player.
